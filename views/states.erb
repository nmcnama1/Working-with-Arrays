<h1>State List</h1>

<!-- iterate through each state in the array and put them into list items individually using the index of the array item as the list items ID -->

<p>I have visited the following states:</p>
<ul>
  <!-- always use quotes around attribute values in html. IDs are more forgivable but it's a good idea in all cases -->
  <!-- also, maybe a little white space round some of these tags -->
  <% @states.each_with_index do |state, index| %>
    <li id="<%= index %>"><%= state %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
